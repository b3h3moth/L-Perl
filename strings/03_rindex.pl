# rindex(string, substring)
# The rindex()function is similar to index() except that it searches the string
# from right to left, instead ofleft to right.
#
# Except for the name of the function itself, the syntax for calling rindex()
# is exactly the same as for index().
#
# It returns Â­1 if the substring is not found.
