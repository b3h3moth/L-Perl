#Slice in brief: how to create a new array with elements of another array using
#indexing.

#In Perl, a slice is a way to select a few elements of an array,  list, or hash
#instead of the entire set of data. You use the @ sign.

#It doesn't make sense to take a single-element slice, so, if you do this, you
#get a warning (use warnings):

#my @club = @football_club[0];

#Scalar value @football_club[0] better written as $football_club[0] at
#./11_slice.pl â”‚line 18.
