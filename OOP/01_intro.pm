package Person;

# A class is a package, so the simplest class is just a package. 
# The extension of the class file is .pm.
# Generally he name of the package is the same as the name of file.
# Perl expects to see a true value as the last thing in the package.
#
# There are three rules to know about Perl's OOP:
# - a class is a package;
# - an object is a reference that knows its class;
# - a method is a subroutine.
