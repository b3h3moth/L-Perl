# A class is a package, so the simplest class is just a package, in this case
# it's a totally empty class.
# The extension of the file is .pm

# There are three rules to know about Perl's OOP:
# 1) a class is a package;
# 2) an object is a reference that knows its class;
# 3) a method is a subroutine.
