#
#This operator quotes its STRING as a regular expression. STRING is
#interpolated the same way as PATTERN in m/PATTERN/. If "'" is used as the
#delimiter, no interpolation is done.
#
#Returns a Perl value which may be used instead of the corresponding
#/STRING/msixpodual expression. The returned value is a normalized version of
#the original pattern.
